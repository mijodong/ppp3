- **`<<`**: `cout`'s output operator.
- **`cout`**: C++'s version of `print`. Abbreviation of character output stream.
- **`import`**: A module import statement. It instructs the computer to make available facilities from a module.
- **`#include`**:  Pre- C++20 way to import headers, but not modules.
- **`main()`**: A necessary function in a C++ program that tells it where to start executing.
- **`module`**: A contained set of functions, classes, and variables that was introduced in C++20.
- **`std`**: A namespace in the C++ Standard Library that contains standard fuctions, classes, and objects.
- **bug**: A logical error in your code.
- **C++**: A compiled language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.
- **command line**: The terminal.
- **comment**: Comments are written to describe what the program is intended to do and provide information useful for humans that can't be directly expressed in code.
- **compiler**: A program that translates the human readable code in a .cpp file into an object file.
- **compile-time**: The period of time when your .cpp files are compiled into object files
- **debugging**: The act of troubleshooting your program of any errors.
- **error**: Any syntax, semantic, spelling, or logic error that causes your program to not compile or run as expected.
- **executable**: The final output file from the compiler and linker that lets you run your program.
- **function**: a named sequence of instructions for the computer to execute in the order which they are written.
- **header file**: A header file includes functions/other code and is imported/included into your program to allow you to access it from your own functions.
- **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment.
- **library**:  A set of functions that can be imported and used in your own program, instead of having to create functions yourself.
- **linker**: A program that links object files into an executable file.
- **object code**: Compiled source code that needs to be linked in order to be executed.
- **output**: What the computer returns as a result of your input.
- **program**: A set of instructions that tells the computer what to do.
- **source code**: Human readable code.
- **statement**: Instructions written in code that performs a specific action (e.g., variable declaration, expression evaluation).


## Chapter 2

- **`++`**: Increment a variable by 1.
- **`<`**: The less than operator symbol.
- **`<=`**: The greater than OR equal to operator symbol.
- **`!=`**: The not equal to operator symbol
- **`=`**: The assignment operator symbol.
- **`==`**: The is equal to operator symbol.
- **`>`**: The greater than operator symbol.
- **`>=`**: The greater than OR equal to operator symbol.
- **`auto`**: Automatically assigns the type of the variable based on the initial value.
- **`cin`**: Input stream from the standard library.
- **`double`**: A data type that represents float numbers.
- **`int`**: A data type that represents whole numbers.
- **`string`**: A data type that represents an array of letters.
- **assignment**: Giving value to a variable.
- **concatenation**: Stringing independent values together with an operator.
- **conversion**: Changing a variable from one data type to another.
- **declaration**: A statement that gives a name and a type to an object.
- **decrement**: Decrease the value by X.
- **definition**: A statement that introduces a new name into a program and sets aside memory for a variable.
- **increment**: Increase a variable by X.
- **initialization**: Give a new variable a starting value.
- **name**: What we give to variables to call them, they start with a letter and contain only letters, digits, and underscores.
- **narrowing**: Converting a variable's data type to a smaller data type.
- **object**: A region of memory with a type that specifies what kind of information can be placed in it. Named objects are variables.
- **operation**: An action applied to an input to get an output using operators.
- **operator**: Acts upon objects to compare/assign values and complete operations.
- **truncation**: When a narrowing conversion rounds down the original value.
- **type**: Defines the properties of the variable and the functions/operations that can be applied to it.
- **type safety**: A feature of programming languages that enforce objects to only use functions/operations applicable to it's type.
- **value**: The data assigned to an object.
- **variable**: A named object with a specific type.
- **widening**: Converting a variable's data type to a bigger data type.
